Brief hacking guide to duff
===========================

Basic nomenclature
==================

Entry n.
  A file, specified on the command line or found via directory recursion,
  included in the set of files checked for duplicates.

Cluster n.
  A collection of entries which represent files with equal contents, i.e. a
  collection of duplicate files.

Directory n.
  A physical directory (inode, not link) which has been searched for entries.

Invalid a.
  An entry becomes invalid if any stage of data gathering failed on it.  An
  invalid entry should not be modified or operated upon.


Important files
===============

duff.c
  Program main, information printing and option handling.
  
duffdriver.c
  Primary program logic; entry collection and cluster reporting.

duffentry.c
  Functions for working with entries.

duffstring.c duffstring.h
  Replacement implementations of various libc string functions.

duffutil.c
  Error reporting and various other utility functions.

duff.h
  Main header file.

sha1.c sha1.h
  Implements SHA1 checksum calculation.


Important functions
===================

duffentry.c: compare_entries()
  The main comparison function for entries.  Start here if you wish to hack
  the comparison algorithm.

duffentry.c: compare_entry_*() and get_entry_*()
  Compares and collects various entry attributes, respectively.  Start here if
  you wish to modify one of the existing comparison methods.

duffdriver.c: process_path() and recurse_directory()
  The main functions for collecting files and making entries.  Start here if
  you wish to hack the traversal algorithm.

duffdriver.c: report_clusters()
  Finds and reports the clusters of duplicate files in the list of entries, or
  collected files.  Start here if you wish to optimise list traversal or alter
  normal program output.

duffdriver.c: has_recursed_directory() and record_directory()
  Records traversed directories (in a very primitive way).  Start here if you
  wish to modify the 'loop detection' algorithm.
