duff - Duplicate file finder
============================

0. Introduction
===============

Duff is a command-line utility for identifying duplicates in a given set of
files.  It attempts to be usably fast and uses the SHA family of message
digests as a part of the comparisons.

The project website is here:

  http://duff.dreda.org/

Duff resides in public Git repository on GitHub:

  https://github.com/elmindreda/duff

The version numbering scheme for duff is as follows:

 * The first number is the major version.  This will be updated upon what the
   author considers a round of feature completion.

 * The second number is the minor version number.  This is updated for releases
   that include minor new features, or features that do not change the
   functionality of the program.

 * The third number, if present, is the bugfix release number.  This indicates
   a release which only fixes bugs present in a previous major or minor release.

3. Building Duff
================

If you got this source tree from a Git repository then you will need to
bootstrap the build environment:

1. `gettextize'  Note that running gettextize may cause a few duplicate entries
in various build files.  If you got the source tree using Git, you can remove
these with `git reset --hard' before moving on.

2. `autoreconf -i'.  Note that this requires that GNU autoconf, automake and
gettext are installed.

If (or once) you have a `configure' script, go ahead and run it.  No additional
magic should be required.  If it is, then that's a bug and should be reported.

This release of duff has been successfully built on the following systems:

  Ubuntu Natty x86_64

10. Release history
===================

Version 0.1 was named `duplicate' and was never released anywhere.

Version 0.2 was the first release named duff.  It lacked a real checksumming
algorithm, and was thus only released to a few individuals, during the first
half of 2005.

Version 0.3 was the first official release, on November 22, 2005, after a
long search for a suitably licensed implementation of SHA1.

Version 0.3.1 was a bugfix release, on November 27, 2005, adding a single
feature (-z), which just happened to get included.

Version 0.4 was the second feature release, on January 13, 2006, adding a
number of missing and/or requested features as well as bug fixes.  It was the
first release to be considered stable and safe enough for everyday use.

Version 0.5 was the third feature release, on April 11, 2011, adding a number
of minor features and fixing a number of bugs.  It was mostly intended to get
the ball rolling again and thus low on features.

Version 0.5.1 was a bugfix release, on January 17, 2012, adding a single bugfix
and a new default cluster header for thorough mode.

Version 0.5.2 was an minor release, on January 29, 2012, adding a number of
optimizations, prefixing error and warning messages with the program name and
modifying the default sampling limit.
